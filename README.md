# -LinkedIn-applicant-review
My coworker and I received several applications from candidates on LinkedIn. To begin the recruitment process, we both carefully reviewed each application, assessing the qualifications and experience of the applicants. Simultaneously, we thoroughly examined their submitted resumes, looking for skills and experiences that align with our job requirements.

After this initial assessment, we identified a select group of candidates who showed promise and potential for the roles we are hiring for. To further engage with these promising candidates, we reached out to them through LinkedIn messages and email. In these communications, we expressed our interest in their profiles, provided them with more information about the job positions, and requested any additional documentation that would help us better evaluate their suitability.

As we received responses from these candidates, we meticulously documented each interaction. This included recording their level of interest, any questions they had about the job, and any additional information they shared with us.

Our next steps involve coordinating and scheduling initial interviews with candidates who met our preliminary criteria. We ensured that our candidate profiles, which include resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and any relevant notes or assessments, were kept up-to-date within our recruitment repository for easy reference and tracking.
